This paper is dedicated to developing a multi-agent text-based strategy game using orchestrated large language models, and investigating the applicability of modern LLMs as automated game masters in the military-political games (WPG) genre.

The work covers the complete cycle of creating such a system, including designing the architecture of a multi-agent environment, orchestrating language models to perform various game functions, and analyzing the results of a pilot launch with real users. Special attention is paid to methods for overcoming typical language model problems in the gaming context: hallucinations, maintaining long-term context, and computational limitations.

The research results demonstrate the potential of modern LLMs for automating the role of game arbiter in text-based strategy games, identify key technical and gameplay limitations of existing approaches, and propose a set of technical solutions to enhance gaming experience, including the application of RAG-based systems and local models to reduce the operational costs of the game system.
